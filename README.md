# Generate-TV-Scripts
RNN Project [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree]

## Project Overview
### Project Description
Generate a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern using Recurrent Neural Network(RNN).

### Project Procedure
- Preprocesse the data
  - Scale continous features that they have zero mean and a standard deviation of 1.
  - Split the data into training, testing, and validation sets
- Build the network
- Train the network
- Make predictions

### Project Results

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)


### Run
In a terminal or command window, run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook Your_first_neural_network.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook Your_first_neural_network.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data
Part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts which consists of only the scenes in Moe's Tavern.
