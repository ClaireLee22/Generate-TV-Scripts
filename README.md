# Generate-TV-Scripts
RNN Project [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree]

## Project Overview
Build an Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) and train the network by using part of Simpsons dataset which only consists the sences in Moe's Tavern. The network will generate a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.
### Project Description
Build a neural network from scratch and use it to predict daily bike rental ridership. 

### Project Procedure
- Preprocesse the data
  - Scale continous features that they have zero mean and a standard deviation of 1.
  - Split the data into training, testing, and validation sets
- Build the network
- Train the network
- Make predictions

### Project Results

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)


### Run
In a terminal or command window, run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook Your_first_neural_network.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook Your_first_neural_network.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data
Download data from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset)

**Files**

- hour.csv : bike sharing counts aggregated on hourly basis. Records: 17379 hours
- day.csv - bike sharing counts aggregated on daily basis. Records: 731 days
